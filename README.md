CandyVim is a WIP distribution of neovim. Right now, it is currently in alpha. It aims to be less of a framework for your own config but more of a complete daily driver package.

I created it because many people asked for my dotfiles and it got out of hand without a proper way to push updates.

## Install

CandyVim is in the AUR. [(Using amethyst of course)](https://github.com/crystal-linux/amethyst)

```bash
ame i candyvim-git
```

You can install it through a bash script although its not recommended since there is no updating method yet.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrshmllow/CandyVim/main/utils/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

Once your in CandyVim, hit "c" on your keyboard to enter your config.
